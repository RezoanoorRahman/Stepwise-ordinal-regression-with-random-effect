While working for a project, I wanted to use stepwise variable selection for an ordinal output in the presence of a random effect. 

*This is not a direct package;* it uses R package **ordinal** for fitting the model and **dplyr** for data manipulation.

For comparing multiple models, I used Akaike's information criterion (aic).
